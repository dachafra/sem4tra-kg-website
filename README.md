# SAD Generator
The SAD Generator,
a Semantic Academic-event Dissemination Generator,
uses Semantic Web technologies to generate a knowledge graph and 
website for academic events.
This knowledge graph provides the data for generating the website.
Furthermore, the knowledge graph can be made available via, e.g, 
a SPARQL endpoint or a Triple Pattern Fragments server.

## Usage

- Build the knowledge graph as described [here](./kg/README.md).
- Generate the website as described [here](./website/README.md).
