# Website generation

## How to generate your own website

- Generate the knowledge graph as explained [here](../kg/README.md).
- Install dependencies: `npm i`.
- Generate website: `npx eleventy`.
- The resulting website can be found in the folder `docs`.

You can host the website locally via `npx eleventy --serve`.

## Template

We use the [event template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/event/).
We need to keep the credits in the footer.
